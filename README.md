This repository contains Python code for implementing a Red-Black Tree data structure and visualizing it using networkx and matplotlib.

# Overview
A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit for representing colors (red or black). This coloring ensures that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions, leading to efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

# Features
RedBlackTree Class: Implements the Red-Black Tree data structure with methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversal (pre-order, in-order, and post-order).

# Node Class
Represents individual nodes in the Red-Black Tree with properties such as key, value, color, and references to parent, left, and right child nodes.

# Visualization
Provides a graphical representation of the Red-Black Tree using networkx and matplotlib. Nodes are visualized with colors (red or black) indicating their respective properties in the tree.
